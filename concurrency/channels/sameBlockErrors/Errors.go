	// ðŸ˜¢ This one also leads to a deadlock
	// Reason : ðŸ‘‰ the entire logic is in the main functtion which is not  a goroutine
	// So when we sent data to a channel it waits until the data is recieved in another go routine usually
	// Since the entire logic is in this main funtion it starts waiting when we sent data across channel
	// Therefore the function will not move forward and deadlock occurs
